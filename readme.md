# Assignment-6
### Kyler Simmons Ayala
###### Using JavaScript code, I was able to create a textarea and a submit button that shows the frequency of every word that is separated by a whitespace. I learned how to make div elements using javascript and deploying them to the UI. I also was able to use string comparisons to organize the words.
